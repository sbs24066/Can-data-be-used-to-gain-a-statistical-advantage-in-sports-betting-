In this project, I use a variety of visualisation techniques to gain a statisitcal insight into goals scored in current Premier League football mathces. I take insights from match's played last season and from the past 5 years respectively.

Using random forrest and linear regression, I have created two machine learning algorithims that predicts the goals scored by each team. 

I combined the statistics that I gathered with the prediction from machine learing models to predict the outcome football match's. so far, it's predicting at a 70% success rate.
